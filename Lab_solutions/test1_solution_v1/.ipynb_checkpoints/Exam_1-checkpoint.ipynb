    "# Exam 1- Higgs ML Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The HiggsML challenge was organized by ATLAS colleagues and ran on Kaggle's platform. The challenge provided a training and test set of Higgs and background events in CSV format. Using this data, participants were tasked with creating a classifier, which they submitted to Kaggle. Kaggle evaluated the classifier against another test set. At the end of the competition, the best performing classifiers were awarded a cash prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run a mini-competition, using the same data, as your first exam. Note that you will not need a Kaggle account, but may wish to get one to get more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is described in https://higgsml.lal.in2p3.fr\n",

    "The Kaggle site is https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson\n",

    "    - Convert CSV to h5 format.\n",
    "    - Load data and plot/compare variables.\n",
    "    - Setup and Train the Classifier. Save the trained classifier (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html )\n",
    "    - Evaluate and compare different classifiers using ROC curves and metric defined by competition.\n",
